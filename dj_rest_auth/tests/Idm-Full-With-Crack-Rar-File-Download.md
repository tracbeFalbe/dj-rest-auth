You may end a sentence with "with," provided you are willing to listen to people tell you that you should not have ended it with a preposition. There is nothing inherently wrong about ending a sentence with a preposition, and never has been.
 
Yes, with is a preposition ("a function word that typically combines with a noun phrase to form a phrase which usually expresses a modification or predication"). Although with previously functioned as an adverb and a conjunction, it has not done so for many centuries, and these uses are now quite obsolete.

One occasionally hears that sentences should not begin with with. There have been many attempts to categorize many words in English as improper to place at the beginning of a sentence. These "rules" are simply a matter of individual preference, not of grammatical correctness. You may begin a sentence with with.
 
While there is currently no draft, registration with the Selective Service System is the most publicly visible program during peacetime that ensures operational readiness in a fair and equitable manner. If authorized by the President and Congress, our Agency would rapidly provide personnel to the Department of Defense while at the same time providing an Alternative Service Program for conscientious objectors.
 
Selective Service registration is required by law as the first part of a fair and equitable system that, if authorized by the President and Congress, would rapidly provide personnel to the Department of Defense while at the same time providing for an Alternative Service Program for conscientious objectors. By registering, a young man remains eligible for jobs, state-based student aid in 31 states, Federally-funded job training, and U.S. citizenship for immigrant men.

The Department of Justice published revised final regulations implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for title II (State and local government services) and title III (public accommodations and commercial facilities) on September 15, 2010, in the Federal Register. These requirements, or rules, contain updated requirements, including the 2010 Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards).
 
**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.
 
**Note:** Use of the with statement is not recommended, as it may be the source of confusing bugs and compatibility issues, makes optimization impossible, and is forbidden in strict mode. The recommended alternative is to assign the object whose properties you want to access to a temporary variable.
 
Normally, an unqualified identifier is resolved by searching the scope chain for a variable with that name, while a qualified identifier is resolved by searching the prototype chain of an object for a property with that name.
 
The with statement adds the given object to the head of this scope chain during the evaluation of its statement body. Every unqualified name would first be searched within the object (through a in check) before searching in the upper scope chain.
 
The object may have an [Symbol.unscopables] property, which defines a list of properties that should not be added to the scope chain (for backward compatibility). See the Symbol.unscopables documentation for more information.
 
The reasons to use a with statement include saving one temporary variable and reducing file size by avoiding repeating a lengthy object reference. However, there are far more reasons why with statements are not desirable:
 
The following with statement specifies that the Math object is the default object. The statements following the with statement refer to the PI property and the cos and sin methods, without specifying an object. JavaScript assumes the Math object for these references.
 
If you're producing an expression that must reuse a long-named reference multiple times, and your goal is to eliminate that lengthy name within your expression, you can wrap the expression in an IIFE and provide the long name as an argument.
 
FMCSA monitors and ensures compliance with motor carrier safety (all carriers) and commercial (for-hire, non-exempt carriers) regulations. Companies may be subject to registration requirements for both safety (safety registration) and commercial regulation (operating authority registration). Companies subject to the safety requirements are also required to obtain a USDOT Number.
 
The FMCSA registration process requires companies to define their type of business operation: Motor Carrier, Broker, Intermodal Equipment Provider (IEP), Cargo Tank Facility, and Freight Forwarder. This determination is **based on self-classification**using criteria such as cargo, operation, and company type.
 
Accordingly, the Agency administers the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSR) and Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) that govern interstate - and some intrastate - commercial trucking and bus industries.
