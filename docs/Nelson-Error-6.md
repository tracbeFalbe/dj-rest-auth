Error 6 is a fault message which appears on the Advantage and Speedwash + range of commercial dishwashers and glasswashers when the drain pump is obstructed by debris like shattered glass or crockery, fruit pieces from beverages, or food waste. When this problem occurs, the phrase 'ERROR 6' will show on your machine's display, the cycle start button will glow red, and the machine will be unusable until the obstruction is cleared.

By following these step-by-step instructions you should be able to resolve Error 6 without the need for an engineer. However, if you are unable to resolve the fault, feel free to call the Nelson Support team on 020 8993 6199 or email office@nelsonwash.co.uk and we will be happy to assist you.
 
Thank u so much Ms dana, for your prompt assistance. The manual that u sent really helped me to figure out the error and by following the steps that r made so easily to understand by mentioning the pictures as welll it really was easy to fix . Thank you so much for making life so easy .
 
The problem with being human is that if you can make a mistake, at some point you will. Keeping this in mind, it seems obvious that we should design things in such a way that mistakes hurt as little as possible, and that means handling errors by default, not discarding them.
 
In your async-becomes-sync example, you could have left the original code structure. One of the benefits of promises is you can return either a promise or a value and the next then() block will have the right value. Your point still stands for more complex examples, but in this case the refactor was somewhat unnecessary.

Good article, while I always suggest using .done() in the promise chains, see Why promises need to be done, your idea that the promises need to always throw the error might be overkill. The dynamic nature of promises means that someone can later attach error handler to a promise chain and handle an error.
 
About 10 months ago, I was writing a library. As I was writing it, I started to look at the whole issue of notifying the caller of errors. In typical fashion, I tried to optimize the error handling problem rather than just do the right thing, and just use error codes. I did a ton of research. Here is a current list of links and articles on the subject.
 
The default and standard way of handling errors since the begining is to just use error codes with some convention of noticing them. For example, you could document the error condition with an api and then set a global variable for the actual code. It is up to the programmer calling the function to notice the error and do the right thing.
 
This is the technique used by operating systems and most libraries. Historically, these systems have never been consistentor compatable with other conventions. The most evolved system for this would probably be the Microsoft COM system. All functions return an HRESULT, which is essentially an error code.
 
I am trying to program the Tiva TM4C123GH6PM part using Uniflash 5.1.0 GUI. When it completes the programming, it attempts to read address 0x20008000, which is reserved memory, so an error is generated.
 
The likely culprit is that the debugger (regardless of GUI or command line) is trying to access that memory region because the generated executable some code that is allocated for that memory. Please check the generated executable, confirm that the memory allocation for the sections are correct. A good place to start is the linker command file.
 
Originally the command line tool also had verification enabled. But the request came from customers to change the default to no verification to speed the flashing process up. Basically, customers felt verification is useful when flashing from the GUI but not needed as the default from command line.
 
The TM4C123GH6PM has only 32kB of SRAM. Therefore, the length is 0x8000. You specify 0x10000 (for 64kB). I think this is the reason for the Uniflash error. Please correct it and try again. Please note your flash size is also wrong. The TM4C123GH6PM has 256kB of flash. You specify 0x10000 which is again 64kB only. Should be 0x40000.
 
I agree that the mappings are not correct, but we are using the boot\_serial\_Tiva.out file with multiple processors. And since the maximum RAM and Flash is not being used, these lines are not an issue.
 
**The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.**
 
The way you should design depends very much on your specific users. Terms, concepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly clear to you and your colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users.
 
When it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence. Exits allow users to remain in control of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated.
 
**Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.**
 
**Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed.**
 
**Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.**
 
I originally developed the heuristics for heuristic evaluation in collaboration with Rolf Molich in 1990 [Molich and Nielsen 1990; Nielsen and Molich 1990]. Four years later, I refined the heuristics based on a factor analysis of 249 usability problems [Nielsen 1994a] to derive a set of heuristics with maximum explanatory power, resulting in this revised set of heuristics [Nielsen 1994b].
 
In 2020, we updated this article, adding more explanation, examples, and related links. While we slightly refined the language of the definitions, the **10 heuristics themselves have remained relevant and unchanged since 1994.** When something has remained true for 26 years, it will likely apply to future generations of user interfaces as well.
 
You may use these heuristics in your own work.

Exceptions are a necessary part of the C++ language, but for most programmers they are worse than worthless - they are unusable. When exceptions were first added to the language back in the days before standardization, they were seen as a brilliant improvement over the hideous setjmp()/longjmp() facility from ANSI C. Because exceptions unwind the stack when they are thrown, they call destructors and clean up all of your untidy messes as they go.
 
When I first started using exceptions for fatal errors, I kept things simple by just throwing instances of std::runtime\_error when I wanted to abort my program. I could pass the constructor of this object a descriptive string as it was constructed, and that same string would be returned when what() was called in the exception handler. Typical usage might look like this:
 
This more or less worked, but it added a lot of lines to the code, and as a rule, the fewer lines, the less typing, the more I like it. In this case I have to construct a separate std::stringstream object to hold the formatted error message (or a character buffer if I choose to go old school and use vnsprintf(), a second line to do the formatting, and a third line to construct and throw the exception.
 
In addition to writing three lines instead of one, I now have to enclose the whole thing in brackets, because the clause following the if statement is multiple lines, which makes the whole thing require five lines of code instead of one!
 
With that, I have an exception that I can use to easily generate fatal error exceptions with as much data as I want. I only have to include a single header file in any code that uses the class, and I can create and throw the exception in a single line of code, which adheres to the C ideologoy of minimal typing.

Prior research shows that learners have idiosyncratic responses to error-correction procedures during instruction. Thus, assessments that identify error-correction strategies to include in instruction can aid practitioners in selecting individualized, efficacious, and efficient interventions. The current investigation conducted an assessment to compare 5 error-correction procedures that have been evaluated in the extant literature and are common in instructional practice for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Results showed that the assessment identified efficacious and efficient error-correction procedures for all participants, and 1 procedure was efficient for 4 of the 5 participants. To examin
