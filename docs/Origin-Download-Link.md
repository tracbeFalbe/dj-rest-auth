Example, I have battlefield 3 on Origin. With this new 'deal', EA games are available on Steam. Is there a way I can link the ownership of games across the two platforms? Or is EA expecting users to buy the game(s) again?
 
I have the same question / problem. I have almost all games on origin, I don't intend to buy them again on Steam. I just want them to also appear in my steam library. I will not buy again. Besides, the value of games on steam at the moment is much lower than what I paid on Origin.
 
i already own BF4 on origin and have it installed i dont what to repurchase the game just so i can play with my friends on steam. is there a way to link it without making a new purchase. i tried your advice but it did not work

I'm still angry over being a pre-order collector's edition SWBF2 back at launch to watch them give everything for free, and now they want me to pay for it all over again, even on Origin "Anniversary Upgrade" etc...
 
The link1 is at the same position in both case but the tf isn't. It comes in consideration when you have different type joints if you don't correctly define the tfs some rotations or translations could not behave as expected.
 
How to link my EA Origin account with Steam? In the FAQ it says to play EA game in Steam, but I have no EA game in Steam it ask me to buy one, but I don't want to buy game since I have the game already bought on the Origin.
 
Hey, no problem at all. So just for clarification, do you own the game on Steam or on Origin? Because if you own the game on Origin you should just be able to download it through your Game Library and then launch it through there.
 
Hello everyone, I got a question and was hoping anyone could give me an answer. I saw Dragon age Inquisition came out on steam, and I saw there is a way to link my origin account with the Steam one if I own the game on steam as well.
 
I only have Origin installed to play Bioware games, and I'd hoped that with their release on Steam I could remove the Origin launcher from the equation altogether. But I don't think EA wants us to do that.
 
I have no intention of buying the games a second time, so I guess the Steam release didn't change anything. It's just a secondary way for them to make money since Steam has a large consumer base to draw from.
 
Really it's a mild, almost nonexistent annoyance that's barely worth complaining about. But when GFWL games migrated to Steamworks, they let your code work as a way to redeem them in Steam. I'd kind of hoped the three Dragon Age games would follow something similar. Wishful thinking.
 
What happens when I call git remote set-url origin just after git init? Does git remote set-url origin create origin? If origin already exists after git init there is no difference between using those commands in my scenario, right?
 
This command means that if at any stage you wish to change the location of your repository(i.e if you made a mistake while adding the remote path using the git add command) the first time, you can easily go back & **"reset(update) your current remote repository path"** by using the above command.
 
This command simply pushes your files to the remote repository.Git has a concept of something known as a **"branch"**, so by default everything is pushed to the **master** branch unless explicitly specified an alternate branch.
 
**You can not call remote set-url origin just after git init**, Because the **git remote set-url command will not create origin, but it changes an existing remote repository URL**.
 
you can check remote with command git remote -v it will show remote url after name, or if this command gives error like fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git then the repository not exists, so you have to add origin with command git remote add
 
We use git remote add origin [email protected]:User/UserRepo.git when adding a new repository to the local directory.and we use git remote set-url origin [email protected]:User/UserRepo.git when changing the head to another repository.ReadMore: -started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories
 
**NOTE**: If you've changed your GitHub username, you can follow the same process as above to update the change in the username associated with your repository. You would only have to update the USERNAME in the git remote set-url command.
 
If you need to edit an already added remote path, just click the 'Edit' button. You should be directed to the "Remote details" window where you can edit the details (URL/Path/Host Type) of the remote path.
 
An alternative approach is to rename the 'old' origin (in the example below I name it simply old-origin) and adding a new one. This might be the **desired approach if you still want to be able to push to the old origin** every now and then:
 
I've just run a Screaming Frog spider against a client's website and it has returned 370 links that are Unsafe Cross-Origin Links. However when I have investigated the links they don't match the description of what an Unsafe Cross-Origin Link should be. They don't have target="\_blank" on them and they all point to internal pages.
 
Because Lighthouse filters out same-host links,there's an edge case you should be aware of if you're working on a large site:if one page contains a target="\_blank" link to another page on your site without using rel="noopener",the performance implications of this audit still apply.However, you won't see these links in your Lighthouse results.

When using git clone (from GitHub, or any source repository for that matter) the default name for the source of the clone is "origin". Using git remote show will display the information about this remote name. The first few lines should show:
 
Expanding insteadOf is a part of ls-remote --url and there is no way to expand pushInsteadOf as well.
 Add a get-url subcommand to be able to query both as well as a way to get all configured URLs.
 
To supplement the other answers: If the remote has for some reason been changed and so doesn't reflect the original origin, the very first entry in the reflog (i.e. the last entry displayed by the command git reflog) should indicate where the repo was originally cloned from.
 
I just did git init to initialize my folder as Git repository and then added a remote repository using git remote add origin URL. Now I want to remove this git remote add origin and add a new repository git remote add origin new-URL. How can I do it?
 
I've been working on a small application allowing users to upload media to a Cloudflare R2 bucket. The high-level stack is pretty simple. It's got a client-side piece (React), a middle-tier service (Fastify on Node), with Cloudflare backing the uploads.
 
To no surprise, downloading that content is a part of the work too. When I began thinking through this, I was planning on streaming the objects through my Fastify server, and then straight to the users' browsers. But then I remembered: there's an very handy feature built into S3 (and therefore R2, which implements the same API).
 
That feature is presigned URLs. When you generate one and hand it out, that person gets time-limited permission to access the file. It'd be a far simpler means of getting a file out of my bucket and onto a user's device.
 
Using a presigned URL would save me a lot of time (and other resources), but I didn't want the user to click the link and navigate away from the page to access the object. So, I opted to use the download attribute available on the tag. Click such a link, and the browser will prompt you to save it to your machine.
 
I was confused, especially because some pretty good sources out there had no mention of why the browser might decide to honor or ignore the download request. Even MDN was pretty... vague about its reliability:
 
Fortunately, the AWS SDK allows you to set custom response headers when you generate a presigned URL. I'm using Node, so that meant using the ResponseContentDisposition property when retrieving the object.
 
This'll give behavioral instructions to the browser, as well as provide a default name for the file when it's downloaded. I get exactly the user experience I want, and I still don't need to mess with streaming anything through my server. Cheaper, easier, and more secure.
 
It might be worth calling out that after I set that Content-Disposition header, the download attribute didn't have any impact on what happened when my link was clicked. It would now always trigger the download.
 
Still, I can see it being useful in keeping around. It'll better signal a link's purpose to other client-side code (maybe you'd like to style download links differently). So, despite it not bring strictly necessary, I'll probably keep using it. I like clarity.
 
There's still a small part of me kicking myself for taking so long to realize this pretty critical piece of the download attribute. But at the same time, I know I'm not the only one who has these moments, so I'm sure the feeling will quickly pass. If anything, let this be an encouragement to share even the smallest bits of learnings you come across out there. People like me might benefit from it.
