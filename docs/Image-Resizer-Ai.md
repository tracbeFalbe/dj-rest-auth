It was a wildly popular PowerToy that allowed you to bulk resize image files so they could all fit on your 1.44 MB floppy disk or be uploaded using you 56 kbps dial-up modem. Life was good in our plastic XP world.

Then came Windows Vista. Despite everyone telling them not to, a few brave souls decided to install the OS. When they tried to install their favorite PowerToy, they were greeted by this disappointing, but beautifully glass-framed error message:
 
A service pack later, my dad finally convinced my mom that it was time to upgrade to Windows Vista. He bought her agigantic, pink laptop with about an hour of batter life. Quickly, however, she noticed there was no option toresize her pictures.
 
Last September, Microsoft resurrected the PowerToys project, and shortly thereafter users began demanding that an image resizer be included. The Microsoft PowerToys team and I got in contact, and we decided to move Image Resizer for Windows into the PowerToys project, thus restoring it to its rightful place.

Image Resizer is a Windows shell extension for bulk image-resizing. After installing PowerToys, right-click on one or more selected image files in File Explorer, and select **Resize with ImageResizer** from the menu.
 
If **Ignore the orientation of pictures** is selected, the width and height of the specified size may be swapped to match the orientation (portrait/landscape) of the current image. In other words: If selected, the **smallest** number (in width/height) in the settings will be applied to the **smallest** dimension of the picture. Regardless if this is declared as width or height. The idea is that different photos with different orientations will still be the same size.
 
The fallback encoder is used when the file cannot be saved in its original format. For example, the Windows Meta File (.wmf) image format has a decoder to read the image, but no encoder to write a new image. In this case, the image cannot be saved in its original format. Specify the format the fallback encoder will use: PNG, JPEG, TIFF, BMP, GIF, or WMPhoto settings.**This is not a file type conversion tool, but only works as a fallback for unsupported file formats.**
 
This utility is part of the Microsoft PowerToys utilities for power users. It provides a set of useful utilities to tune and streamline your Windows experience for greater productivity. To install PowerToys, see Installing PowerToys.
 
One more question: Is it also possible to do this differently for each card? There are maps where I would like to have a larger image and on another I would like to have a smaller image.
With your setting it is changed for all cards of a card type.
 
**The Backstory:**I was thinking since the NuGet .NET package management site is starting to fill up that I should start looking for gems (no pun intended) in there. You know, really useful stuff that folks might otherwise not find. I'll look for mostly open source projects, ones I think are really useful. I'll look at how they built their NuGet packages, if there's anything interesting about the way the designed the out of the box experience (and anything they could do to make it better) as well as what the package itself does. Today, it's **imageresizer**.
 
Bertrand Le Roy has long been an advocate of doing image resizing correctly on .NET and particularly on ASP.NET. Last week he posted a great post on a new library to choose from; a library that is pure .NET and works in medium trust. It's "imageresizer." What a creative name! ;)
 
Their default NuGet package is called ImageResizer, and their ASP.NET preconfigured web.config package is "ImageResizer.WebConfig" which includes a default intercepting module to get you the instant gratification you crave. I used NuGet to install-package imageresizer.webconfig.
 
And now with the **intercepting HttpModule** installed with imageresizer.webconfig I can add ?width=100 to the end of the query string and I get a nice resized image that fits into the constraints of "100 wide." It's a trivial example, but it's a nice touch to have them do the "figure out how tall this should be" work for me.
 
Of course, I'm sure you could DoS (Denial of Service) someone's system with resizing request, but for small sites their intercepting module is a quick fix and a great example. DoS problems aren't unique to CPU intensive requests and a problem solved elsewhere.
 
I'd like to clarify that it's not just for small sites. It's been running large social networking sites for years, and there are at least 6 companies using it with 10-20TB image collections (it powers a lot of photo album systems). It's designed for web farms, Amazon EC2 clusters, and even..... Microsoft Azure.
 
"Performance-wise, it's just as fast as GDI (despite Bertrand's article, which he'll be updating soon). Default behavior is to favor quality over performance (since it's never more than a 40% difference even with the worst settings), but that IS adjustable."
 
For more sophisticated use they include a separate API dll where you can do even more like cropping, rotating, flipping, watermarking and even conversion. Bertrand has a chart that explores their speed issues, as they are slower than straight GDI and Windows Imaging Components, but as I said, they are pure managed code and work in Medium Trust which is a huge win. Their quality is also top notch.
 
ImageResizer also includes plugin support that you can buy. Genius, seriously, I tip my hat to these guys. The most popular and useful features are free, and crazy easy to use. If you want to do even more you buy plugins like DiskCache for huge performance wins, S3Reader or AzureReader for Amazon or Azure support, and lots of free plugins for 404 handling, DropShadows and more. So polished. Kudos to Nathanael Jones and team for a really nice use of ASP.NET, .NET, NuGet and a clever open source library with a plugin model for profit.

Hi has anyone had any trouble with the Shopify image-resizer page where you upload you images click on submit and nothing happens. I've been using this for ages now, and now the last couple goes, I've had to use other methods as nothing is happening! Have they disabled it and not bothered to close the page? If so I'll have to find other ways. I was very convenient for me!

UPDATE: Funny how after a couple of hours, the page suddenly works! Good!
 
I'm happy to tell you that the image re-sizer page is not being shutdown! In terms of the issues you were having, we haven't gotten any additional reports of the page misbehaving. I saw that you updated your post a bit later to let us know that the page was working normally for you. **This makes me think that your browser may have had some saved data (think your cookies/cache) that was impacted the page. This data refreshes itself occasionally so that would explain why it didn't work at one time, but is back to normal for you.**Google Chrome is a browser that's pretty chronic for cookies issues, for example.
 
In the end, I'm happy to hear the page started working for you as expected! **Do you mind me asking why you were looking to resize some images? Are you working on a new store, or making some new products?**If you're open to it, I'd love to take some time to explore your online store and see what you've built! One of my favourite things about the Community is having the chance to connect with folks like you to chat about your business. I'd love to have the chance to checkout what you've built - I may be able to advise on some feedback for you, too!

So I loaded up the resizer and tried to replicate this error, but things seemed to be working fine for me. This suggests that this is a local issue. A cookies/cache clear is a good first step, but can you please try these other steps for me to see if they solve things:
 
I keep having this problem again and again. It has happened many times and just now I have probably tried it 25 times in two different browsers (safari and chrome on mac). Is there any other way to make it work than to just wait and try again later? Appreciate any answers, thanks!
 
Usually, this issue is caused by browsers or devices holding into some saved data within the browsers being used to access content. We see similar things with Google Chrome and theme updates, for example. **Beyond waiting for things to resolve on their own, you can try a cache and cookies clear of the browsers, or try use a private viewing window in these browsers and see if the resizer will work for you then.**
 
The reason why time seemed to solve the issue for our OP is because these browsers and devices do eventually refresh with the most recent version of the content appearing on pages, but you can't force this to happen unless you manually clear your cache and cookies and allow for the browser to have new content to remember for faster access times in the future.
