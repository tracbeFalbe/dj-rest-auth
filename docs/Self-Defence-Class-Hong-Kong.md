The difference here is you are **not required to memorise** or recall special techniques or movements, but, rather, you work on your already existing natural reactions and instincts.

The Best Self Defence Instructor in the world is a title that would be under dispute by many people. After all coaching self defence has many layers to it including he soft skills such as awareness and verbal de escalation to the physical skills of the actual fighting.
 
There are of course many people who could step forward to claim the title of the worlds best self defence instructor if there was to be a competition for it from Geoff Thompson, Peter Consterdine, Richard Dimitri, Tony Blauer, Mo Teague, Hock Hockenheim and many many others. Its probably right that no one has ever officially received that title because there are so many class acts out there. Yet despite this there are room for more and one such amazing talent is Peter Sciarra. However lets take a look at him in action before I reveal details of this amazing instructor
 
Like a lot of people I first heard of Peter from his youtube videos and was amazed at them, his speed and skill was simply awesome. Im not often blown away by someone because there is so much trash out there on the web in the world of self defence instructors, yet here I was watching the videos above and simply blown away at the skill level on display.
 
Immediately I searched the web and discovered that Peter lives in the sunny land of Australia and I wanted to know more about this guy, what system does he teach and where did he learn such amazing skills? So I simply got in touch and thankfully Peter has supplied the following information but before I write any more this is what Hock Hockenheim had to say about Peter Sciarra:
 
I was introduced to integrating Martial systems right from the start, and I never did the traditional thing. Got my first black belt when I was 16.I was extremely dedicated,training up to 3-4 hours a day. This really set a solid foundation for future training.I also got into weight training form a young age. I even built my first gym set out of bricks and broom sticks when I was 12 years.
 
Being a unknown instructor,I put out a number of videos on youtube of me doing my stuff,this got a lot of international attention. As a result I have taught seminars in around Australia,U.S, New Zealand and Hong Kong and I will coming to Europe this year.
 
WOW!! What an honest article. Now I do not know if Peter is the best self defence instructor in the world but I can simply tell by looking at his combination of experience and skills he is among the best out there. My verdict is simple if you can get a chance to train with Peter then do so, he is available for seminars across the globe and his website is \_home.html where you will find all his information including how to contact him.
 
Peter is one of a few instructors out there who are ushering in a new dawn of self defence instructors who are able to mix grappling and striking, weapon work and awareness and avoidance into one amazing package. personally this is the direction that quality self defence training needs to go in and I think its fantastic that Peter has taken the brave step to put his stuff on the web and showcase his skills.

Being a teenager living in the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia, getting into fights at school and on the street was becoming a regular occurrence, so I decided to learn a self-defence system. I actually chose Wing Chun by luck as it was one of the biggest ads in the Yellow Pages at the time.
 
Wing Chun is a very realistic martial art with no unnecessary movement. Its principals are based on the laws of physics making it very efficient, so it means that it can be used by anyone regardless of gender, strength, fitness or flexibility level.
 
Wing Chun is an art that teaches meditative mindful practice methods which enable us to take the time to really observe our mind and direct it to the body to relax and open up all the tension and energetic blockages. This results in balancing the mind and body, which leads to a more peaceful mind and the ability to use our bodies in a remarkably powerful and efficient way in all postures and movements of daily life (not just in martial arts movements)!

 
Also, thanks to social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube, the Wing Chun world is connected now more than ever so it enables teachers to share their knowledge which has resulted in not only the revival but also in the prominence of the art.
 
Furthermore, as a self-defence system, Wing Chun is very different from boxing or MMA in that it is made for realistic self-defence rather than tournament or ring fighting. For this reason, men and women are practicing Wing Chun for self-defence and many military and special forces around the world are incorporating Wing Chun in their hand to hand combat training.
 
People come to us not only for self-defence but for many other reasons. Maybe they want to gain better control of their mind (or change their relationship with their thoughts and emotion) which leads to a calmer and more focused mind, to get rid of muscular pain, correct postural misalignments, learn to move their bodies in a more efficient way which can be used for daily life or sports, to gain confidence and overall for learning to use this art as a self-development tool!
 
Yes. I think it mainly because of the location of our school, and obviously the fact that all of our classes are taught in English. I think the Mindfulness aspect of our particular method of Wing Chun practice is very appealing the professional expat community in Hong Kong.
 
The benefits of this type of practice are very tangible in that it has fast and noticeable physiological effects as well as mental and emotional balancing. Since many of our students are in high executive positions, they say that they are able to use these benefits when dealing with potentially stressful situations.
 
Another huge attraction to this method of practice is the fact that the practitioner will be able to use their bodies to generate great power with very little muscular effort. This is through tapping into the connective tissues around the joints and using them for movements as opposed to brute muscular force. This, I believe, is the main reason that we are getting literally hundreds of overseas visitors from all different Wing Chun lineages, and many of them are actually masters who are running fulltime Wing Chun schools of their own.
 
In Scarborough, in eastern Toronto, my family held Filipino martial arts classes from April 1999 to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Every Saturday, like a household chore, we assembled our gym, our slice of Philippine life, into being. Setting it up in church halls and community centres during down years, we hauled our large stack of gym mats into the minivan, wedging a bucket of rattan sticks and sparring gear in between. In better financial situations, when we had a lockable office space, all we took was our freshly laundered and starched uniforms: white g
