"We are excited to have MotorStorm Arctic Edge added to the arsenal of quality PSP titles available this holiday," said Scott A. Steinberg, Vice President, Product Marketing, SCEA. "MotorStorm Arctic Edge takes full advantage of PSP functionality by bringing exciting features such as eight-player online and ad-hoc modes, photo mode, and the ability to create a custom music playlist to suit your driving mood."
 
Entering the latest MotorStorm Festival location, players will be greeted by a rugged Alaskan landscape featuring narrow mountain passes, giant ice caves, and slippery ice bridges showcased in 12 amazing new track designs. Players will need lightning-fast reflexes to negotiate the dangerous arctic conditions, including sudden avalanches triggered by vehicle horns, collapsing ice bridges, bobsleigh corners, and three different racing altitudes. Combat-like racing takes center stage as vehicles are treated as weapons to fight off other racers.

With dramatic forces of nature and humans colliding, MotorStorm Arctic Edge gives players more aggressive tools in their competitive arsenals. Along with six vehicle classes from the original MotorStorm, two new snow-specific classes are introduced - the nimble Snowcat and the more forceful Snow Machine. Players can personalize each vehicle in the livery by updating with a selection of wheels, exhaust, spoilers and sponsorship stickers. Also, to further simulate realistic game play, cutting-edge AI analyzes the race and surroundings and reacts to situations in real time, locating the best routes and changing the level of aggression based on cumulative player actions.
 
In multiplayer, MotorStorm Arctic Edge allows up to eight players to compete against each other wirelessly via Ad-Hoc Mode. Alternatively, players can compete via online multiplayer using Infrastructure mode to make it to the summit of the online global leaderboards.
 
Featuring a compilation of 20 licensed tracks from top artists and more, the MotorStorm Arctic Edge in-game soundtrack heightens the game's icy off-road pandemonium, motivating players to blast through packed snow and obliterate the competition. For the PSP player who prefers custom tunes, music can be added from a memory stick.
