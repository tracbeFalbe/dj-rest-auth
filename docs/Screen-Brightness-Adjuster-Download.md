Dimmer is a small and free application for Windows, designed to help you **adjust the brightness of your computer screen**, monitor or display. This becomes very useful when you are in near or total darkness and the minimum brightness from your display or screen is still too much. Dimmer offers a fast and easy way to correct this, so you can adjust the brightness of your displays. It can dim all your screens and monitors; LCD, TFT and LED backlit types (even old CRTs). It supports multiple screens, displays and monitors with convenient individual controls to adjust each one.

Always wondered **how to reduce your screen brightness**? Or, **how to dim your computer monitor**, screen or display? Wonder no more. Dimmer was created for this exact task, to help you lower the computer screen brightness, so you can work with no detriment to your eyes.
 
By reducing the brightness of your screens, Dimmer helps to protect you from excessive light radiation which damages your eyes. It has helped to save the eyesight of thousands of people since 2007. **Some say it's better than carrots.** Dimmer is designed to run on all versions of Windows in a quick, easy and intuitive way. It's also very lightweight on system resources, ideal for everyday use.

The need for this program came about when working at night with minimum ambient light in the room. This was uncomfortable and damaging to the eyes. So one day (back in 2004) I decided to develop Dimmer to solve this problem. The monitor brightness can now be easily adjusted via a slider and/or text input controls which are very easy to use. I eventually released it to the public in 2007.
 
Another convenient feature is that Dimmer does not require installation. It's a portable application. Simply extract into a folder and run. The program stores its settings into a file in the program folder (for your convenience) so the Windows Registry is not used. When no longer needed, just delete the program folder. When Dimmer runs, it will remember and dim the brightness to the level it was last used.
 
Dimmer has been much acclaimed over the years for its simplicity and as the best dimming software for displays, screens or monitors. Feel free to recommend it to your friends and family and you may link to this page if you wish. Hope you enjoy and find this software useful.

ACPI is a power interface management standard which is implemented inoperating system kernels. By default Linux kernel uses an inbuiltdriver for keyboard keys, which is often non compatible with somekeyboards.
 
Hence, we specify the option acpi\_backlight=vendor which tells thekernel to take precedence of vendor driver over kernel driver. Theoption acpi\_osi=linux tells the kernel to enable inbuilt ACPIworkarounds for Linux drivers; which can be the case if the devicedriver has issues for Linux architecture.
 
My computer is a Lenovo Legion Y740-15I with a nvidia GeForce RTX 2060.I have tried all solutions available but none worked. One day by chance when I installed tensorflow I had to install **CUDA Toolkit 11.0** and his compiler.
 
Obviously, you should run this with the package of your current boot kernel. If you are unsure, run uname -r to get the kernel name. Moreover, package names after dpkg-reconfigure auto-complete in my bash, but your settings may vary.
 
Note that Nvidia drivers on MacBook Air 3,2 have a whole set of other, unrelated issues, some specifically related to brightness control. In particular, you need to add X-related device option settings EnableBrightnessControl=1 as per Brightness not working after installing NVIDIA driver. Also, MacBook Air 3,2 by default may fail to boot usable graphics altogether in Nvidia drivers, which is fixed by setting certain PCI-E registers in grub as per Proprietary NVidia drivers with EFI on Mac, to prevent overheating. Both were applied before on my machine and remained active after the upgrade, so not related.
 
I had much easier solution. Somehow unintentionally I've disabled "Handle display brightness keys" option in Xfce Power Manager. When pressing the brightness keys, the notification popup was displayed but the brightness bar wasn't moving. I took quite a while before I realized this.
 
Open the "Ubuntu Mainline Kernel Installer" app. Select the latest Kernel version which is at the very top of the list and click the Install button. As of this writing, version 5.15.1 is the latest. Restart the computer and the brightness keys work.
 
This worked for me. Ubuntu's own brightness control and keyboard brightness control work. Even when I turn the computer off and on, the setting does not change. This is real brightness control. When I lowered the brightness in third party programs, the screen became slightly bluish.
 
As a reference, my GRUB\_CMDLINE\_LINUX\_DEFAULT is set to be that of the original one, i.e. GRUB\_CMDLINE\_LINUX\_DEFAULT="quiet splash". In addition, I installed the brightness-controller, but I'm not sure whether it helped me or not.
 
For a Lenovo Legion 5 with AMD Ryzen and Nvidia 1060Ti on Ubuntu 21.04 I tried multiple fixes listed by others in this thread (adding EnableBrightnessControl=1 in xorg.conf, updating kernel - yes, I was desperate, etc.), however that what helped was the following:
 
I have a similar problem on Ubuntu 22 (brightness slider doesn't change anything) and tried the proposed solution without success. So I tried to change acpi\_backlight=video instead acpi\_backlight=vendor (as other answer propose) and brightness slider start to work.
 
2 From all the options choose the latest one (the one that has the greater number) and you'll see that there are lots of the, some end in -server, others end in -open; what you have to do is choose the one that ends in nothing, for example, in the picture above I used the first one 'Using NVIDIA ... nvidia-driver-535 (propietary)' and then I clicked on apply changes, it made me restart and voila!
 
I had a problem that my screen was very dark when on battery, ie not plugged in Despite exhaustive searching on microsoft, dell and throughout my computer, I was unable to find a slide bar that nearly every support blog says is there! Finally, after nearly a year of frustration, my IT contractor told me to do the following: immediately when powering on the computer, begin tapping the Fn F2 key. Continue this for about 5-10 seconds until the screen shows up with a brightness bar that you can then adjust. So simple, yet nowhere have I seen this posted.
 
With regard to automatic brightness adjustment, I have also found that to be troublesome on a Windows laptop (HP, in my case). The display would slew from bright to dim or vice versa in a few seconds, for no apparent reason. It would be very frustrating to live with that for an extended period of time.
 
I had the same issue and the suggestion to update the driver under Device Manager didn't work for me (it would simply say the driver was up-to-date). Installing Intel Graphics Command Center and adjusting the brightness from there worked (the brightness range goes from -60 to 100). Also, I would recommend to install Dell's SupportAssist because it found newer updates to the graphics driver that a simple Windows update missed.
 
Yesterday there was no problems and it wasn't 100% bright. Might be due to an update. Normally I was adjusting the brightness with F11 and F12, they don't work now. Other keys suchs as F7 and F9 work without problem. When I search for "adjust screen brightness" I can see that there is a menu for that but when I click it shows me search results page with all settings, and there is no "adjust screen brightness".
 
Also I have tried to adjust screen brightness from power options but "screen brightness" doesn't exit there anymore. And I have reinstalled Intel drivers for graphics, it didn't help. What else I can do?
 
To uninstall it, right click the Windows Start icon, choose Device Manager, expand Monitors, double click the Generic PnP Monitor and press Uninstall on the Driver tab. Now you have brightness controls again :)
 
There is an Uninstall button in TeamViewer next to the Extras->Options->Advanced->Advanced Network Options->Install monitor driver label if you have installed this driver, but that did not work for me.
 
In my Lenovo G500 laptop after installing Windows 10 I couldn't adjust the screen brightness. And I couldn't see the Generic PnP Monitor option under the Monitor section of my device manager list. I had installed the **Intel HD 4000 Graphics** and **AMD Radeon Graphics** drivers. Enabling and disabling it doesn't help eith
