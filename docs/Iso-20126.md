**Hendrickson** is a worldwide leader in manufacturing and supplying a wide range of air suspension systems, axle and brake systems, bumpers, stabilizers, tire pressure control systems, lift axle systems, and springs to the commercial vehicle industry. Originally founded as The Hendrickson Motor Truck Company by Magnus Hendrickson in 1913, this Chicago-based company has experienced immense growth over the years. Its operations are no longer limited to the US but in other parts of the world, including Canada, France, India, Australia, China, Austria, Romania, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. But, it remains committed to providing the commercial vehicle industry with innovative products that enhance productivity and profitability.
 
The authors observed the IRAS 20126+4104 region with the Chandra ACIS-Iinstrument on 2003 March 17 for a total exposure time of 39.35 ks. C-band (6cm) continuum observations of the massive star-forming region IRAS 20126+4104were conducted with the VLA operated by NRAO on 2011 August 7. These X-rayand radio data are augmented by NIR and optical archival data. For the Mid-IRwavelength regions, the authors searched the Spitzer Enhanced ImagingProducts Point Source catalog.Catalog Bibcode2015ApJS..219...41MReferencesX-ray and radio observations of the massive star-forming region IRAS 20126+4104 Montes V.A., Hofner P., Anderson C., Rosero V. =2015ApJS..219...41M (SIMBAD/NED BibCode)ProvenanceThis table was created by the HEASARC in March 2016 based on the CDS catalogJ/ApJS/219/41 files table1.dat and table5.dat.Parameters**Source\_Number**
 A unique identification number for each Chandra source in this catalog in order of increasing J2000.0 Right Ascension.**Original\_Name**
 The J2000.0 position-based Chandra source designation as originally specified in the published catalog (except that the 'CXOU' prefix rather than the 'CXO' prefix has been used). These original names are deprecated because they do not conform with the IAU standard for such names, since the coordinates have been rounded rather than truncated, and the Declination part of the name is given to more precision than the CDS Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celestial Objects recommends.**Name**
 The corrected J2000.0 position-based Chandra source designation, using the prefix 'CXOU' for Chandra X-ray Observatory, Unregistered. These names conform with the IAU standard for such names, since the coordinates have been truncated rather than rounded, and the Declination part of the name is given to a precision of arcseconds, as the CDS Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celestial Objects recommends for Chandra sources, e.g., 'CXOU J201347.0+411541'.**RA**
 The Right Ascension of the X-ray source in the selected equinox. This was given in J2000.0 sexagesimal coordinates to a precision of 0.001 seconds of time in the original table.**Dec**
 The Declination of the X-ray source in the selected equinox. This was given in J2000.0 sexagesimal coordinates to a precision of 0.01 arcseconds in the original table.**LII**
 The Galactic Longitude of the X-ray source.**BII**
 The Galactic Latitude of the X-ray source.**Count\_Rate**
 The observed Chandra ACIS-I count rate of the X-ray source in the 0.5-8 keV band, in counts per second. This was converted by the HEASARC from the units of ct ks-1 used in the original table.**Flux**
 The observed X-ray flux of the source in the 0.5-8 keV band, in erg s-1 cm-2. The details of the models used to fit the X-ray spectra of the Chandra sources and to derive fluxes are given in Section 3.1.3 of the reference paper. No reliable fits were found for 12 of the 150 sources, and for these 12 sources no fluxes are listed.**Hardness\_Ratio**
 The hardness ratio, HR, of the X-ray source. HR is defined as (hx - sx)/(hx + sx) where hx is the count rate in the 2-8 keV energy range and sx is the count rate in the 0.5-2 keV band. Values of +/-1.00 for HR thus indicate that the source was only detected in the hard or soft energy bands, respectively. A blank value for the hardness ratio (HR) indicates that the source was only detected in the full (0.5-8 keV) energy range.**Var\_Flag**
 The variability of the X-ray source, coded as follows: V = Variable; FL = Flaring; (blank) = Constant. **TwoMASS\_Name**
 The 2MASS near-infrared (NIR) source designation of the counterpart to the X-ray source using the form that the CDS Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celestial Objects recommends, viz., '2MASS JHHMMSSss+DDMMSSs'. The authors used the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source Catalog to find the NIR counterparts. A matching radius of 1 arcsecond was chosen for X-ray sources with off-axis positions of 3', the authors found that 80 of the ACIS sources (53%) have optical counterparts.**Jmag**
 The 2MASS J-band magnitude of the NIR counterpart to the X-ray source.**Hmag**
 The 2MASS H-band magnitude of the NIR counterpart to the X-ray source.**Ks\_Mag**
 The 2MASS Ks-band magnitude of the NIR counterpart to the X-ray source.Contact PersonQuestions regarding the IR20126CXO database table can be addressed to theHEASARC Help Desk.Page Author: Browse Software Development Team

Worsted blue plain, this fabric is suitable for suit wear and included in the The Bingley bunch. Made of wool and silk, it is recommended for garments to be worn in all seasons.
The fabric is 148 cm high and the weight is 210 g/m.
 
Before placing in the wardrobe, every garment should be aired without exposing it to direct sunlight, then brushed using a brush with natural bristles, and any stains removed. Also, check that the pockets are empty and that there are no food or drink stains, as these invite insects.
 
We recommend only going to the dry cleaners when absolutely necessary because as a result of the solvents used, every dry clean impoverishes the natural fibres, changing their characteristics and shortening the life of your suits.
