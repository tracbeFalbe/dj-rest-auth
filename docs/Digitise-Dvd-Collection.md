Digitizing Hidden Special Collections and Archives: Amplifying Unheard Voices is a grant competition administered by the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) for digitizing rare and unique content stewarded by collecting organizations in the US and Canada.
 
Launched in 2021, the program is designed to support efforts to digitize materials that deepen public understanding of the histories of people of color and other communities and populations whose work, experiences, and perspectives have been insufficiently recognized or unattended. See details at Apply for an Award.

The program supports digitization projects that will thoughtfully capture and share the untapped stories of people, communities, and populations who are underrepresented in digital collections in ways that contribute to a more complete understanding of human history.
 
The program prioritizes projects that foreground meaningful engagement with the underserved communities whose stories the source materials tell, and that build inclusive teams across institutional and geographic boundaries.
 
CLIR is an independent, nonprofit organization that forges strategies to enhance research, teaching, and learning environments in collaboration with libraries, cultural institutions, and communities of higher learning.
 
I agree 100%. There are much better options for digitizing and managing collections information, such as creating or joining one of the Symbiota portals. Though centered on North American herbaria, Symbiota is not geographically or taxonomically limited.

Yeah, there are many advantages to having museum/herbaria specimens accessioned as such and in databases specifically for those (which would typically have a lot more info than is present on iNat). Maybe if there were an small abandoned collection that would not be digitized if there were no other option, iNat would make sense. But otherwise, some other option would likely be better.
 
I recently read a paper proposing just this. I thought it was a good idea but some of you have pointed out issues I (and apparently the authors) did not consider. Here it is iNaturalist as a tool to expand the research value of museum specimens
 
iNaturalist is a platform for helping to connect people to nature first, and a database second. If iNat caused these people to slow down for a second and pay attention to a non-human organism when they might not have otherwise, then these observations have value.
 
The core mission is to connect people with wild nature, digitizing existing collections does seem far from this emphasis on one individual interacting with nature in the wild. Given that group accounts are not officially sanctioned, and given the intended focus on an observer-identifier conversations about an observation, herbarium collection accounts would seem to be problematic. Herbarium/museum digitization projects perhaps belong in non-interactive accessible online databases akin to Plants of the World Online.
 
perhaps there are ways to just integrate those databases more. FOr instance one dedicated iNat page for each symbiota record (or the ability to generate one) where commentary and annotations etc could occur. Probably not the way the devs are heading but, i like the idea anyhow
 
I think that there are several potentially serious pitfalls (like IDs disagreeing btw iNat and the collection). I would also wonder how the issue of duplication is solved. If the collection itself is linked to GBIF (which most in my experience are), and iNat is linked as well, do two records show up for one organism observed? This would be even more problematic if the IDs happen to disagree (as referenced above). Also, what happens if the original observer deletes their account and then their observations are gone from iNat? Is a good chunk of the info/utility of that collection lost for good?
 
I appreciate any information. I was lucky enough to get this great gig to archive/digitize a very large collection. I'll have a turntable and a phono amp with balanced outputs that will be dedicated to digitizing records. I'm not clear if the PRO or DAC is best for my needs. Its sole existence will be to record the collection. But my confusion lies in connectivity. I have a few computer options from a new desktop and nice old MacBook. I understand:
 
The Macintosh also has an optical output, most likely SPDIF, can you check that in the manual?
Then the Macintosh phone preamp would do the A/D conversion, which should be ok according to the price.
 
In a good case of luck you could save a lot of money, e.g., if your Mac also has a digital SPDIF input 
then you can connect it directly to your Mac using a TOSLINK cable (if this is an optical SPDIF port).
 
@KaiS: using an ADI-2 FS is maybe not feasible here or the best possible solution as it has no USB interface towards PC, and currently it is not clear what I/O ports are available on the Mac. I fear some tiny analog plugs, if any, I wouldn't use them in such a setup.
 
I would digitize the signal as early as possible, either on the Macintosh phono preamp and the SPDIF connection to Apple.
Or by using the ADI-2 Pro FS R BE for A/D conversion and then via USB to the Apple computer.
 
Quality of the recording is very important. Client uses all McIntosh components and Thorens turntables. The entire collection is classical and jazz. 
I'm not sure of the future of the ADI component, there are no computers on premises. I'll be using a wireless hotspot for my personal needs.
 
If 96 kHz /24 bit is OK, the McIntosh MP100 directly connected to a computer is the way to go.
For higher resolutions, beyond that (in my opinion having no benefit), an additional interface would be needed.
 
"USB-B Port For "Ripping": The McIntosh MP100 is equipped with a USB-B port for connecting the phono preamp to your computer. When used with a properly configured conversion program, the MP100 can "rip" your vinyl records to a computer via USB to produce high quality digital music files. The USB-B port provides digital audio signals at 96kHz with 24-Bit resolution from the selected Phono input."
 
I completely missed that. So digitizing as soon as possible is possible. I'll have to check out my available computers tomorrow and report back. One is a MacMini 2014 (I think) and the other my 2012 MacBook I5 (I think). Those are my two preferred to take with me on this job.
 
Also, I was excited about using this hardware / software and thinking about getting a FS. Which should be fine if those computers work. I could fit that in my system, I got some stuff that I would love to be more accessible.
 
I agree, it all depends on what your client wants. 
In my case I was the client myself when I made 18-20 needle-drop recordings of beloved LP:s during the first year of the pandemi.
I found that it was a good idea to go the shortest way from turntable to recording on a computer so I used an ADL GT40a for analog to digital conversion. The little box has also a capable phono stage which makes the chain even shorter. From the GT40a via USB cable to a computer where I used the latest version of Audacity (available for Windows and Mac).
Audacity is very good because you learn a lot about recording while using it. It is not only about recording at the right level and chosing resolution (up to 24/192) but also how to remove pops and clicks, rumble and surface noise from your recorded files.
I haven't tried the RME ADI-2 Pro (instead of the ADL box) for recording yet but I am sure it will produce diigtized music files to meet the highest demands. 
And ... did I mention how important it is to clean your stylus och the vinyl surface before you start?
Happy learning and best of luck!
 
I bought it in replacement of my Philips CDR765 CD recorder which died after 15 years of operation. Philips CDRs have their own band and singers in the gadget. When you start recording from analogue source Philips CDR recognize the music, calls its band and singer and they perform the song 100 times better than the original which then gets recorded (I rerecorded all my original digital music through Philips CDR765 analogue input). I expected something similar from ADL GT40, but there was nothing of that kind. I recorded songs coming from analogue source in high resolution but there was no difference to original, it did not make it better. I returned it and fortunately Amazon refunded my money with no questions asked.

 
For me, Audacity is not a professional tool under Windows if there is no support for ASIO drivers. With an ASIO driver, I am always on the safe side that you bypass the Windows sound system completely.
 
Thanks for clarifying your position, Ramses. I am sure you are right, you are the expert.
I am just a user who wanted to share some experience with the person who started the thread. I found a method that worked for me in my home setting.
I hold RME in high regard and I am sure that there are other ways to reach the goal - and get even better results at a somewhat higher cost level. The ADI-2 for example is a much better unit in various ways including a better dac and headphone amp.
And if you (or a client) want, you can even make DSD files.
 
What if something simple goes wrong during transfer, e.g. a channel imbalance:
No problem with PCM / WAV, batch process all your files at once.
DSD: either do all transfers again or convert to a PCM interstep, loosing all theoretical advantages of DSD.
 
In addition to the aforementioned drawbacks of absurd sampling rates used with Vinyl Transfer, let's also consider the possibility of transferring undesirable Non-Audio content. A Tone-Arm with it's associated wiring makes a fine Antenna, and EMI/RFI components encoded in the transfer will lead to no end of Distortion.
