One of the most common reasons for denied claims is incorrect coding. It can occur while using the wrong code to describe a service or procedure or the wrong code for the patient's diagnosis. It is important to thoroughly review all codes before submitting a claim and ensure that they accurately reflect the services provided and the patient's diagnosis to prevent incorrect coding.

Another common reason for denied claims is needing more information. It can include missing patient or provider information or details about the services provided. To ensure that all claims get included, it is essential to thoroughly review them before submitting them to ensure that all necessary information gets included.
 
You can cover specific procedures or services through prior authorization in most insurance plans. A claim must be submitted with prior authorization to be allowed. It is essential to check with the patient's insurance plan to determine if prior authorization is required and obtain it if necessary.
 
Insurance plans often have exclusions or limitations on the services they will cover. If a claim gets submitted for a service that is not covered by the patient's insurance plan, it is likely to be denied. To prevent this denial, it is important to check with the patient's insurance plan to determine which services are covered and obtain prior authorization if necessary.
 
Sometimes claims are denied because they are duplicates of a claim that got submitted already. When a provider submits the same claim multiple times or if submitted by both provider and patient, such a denial occurs. To prevent duplicate claims, it is essential to carefully review all claims before submitting them and check for duplicates before resubmitting any denied claims.
 
The timely filing refers to the deadlines that insurance plans often have for submitting claims. If a claim is submitted after the deadline, it will likely gets denied. These deadlines vary by insurance plan and can range from 30 days to several months after the service is provided.
 
Preventing timely filing denials is vital for maintaining the financial health of the medical practice, as denied claims can result in lost revenue and increased administrative burden. After the service gets provided, it is important to submit claims as soon as possible. This can be achieved through efficient and effective billing processes, such as electronic claims submission and tracking systems.

In some cases, providers may request an extension of the timely filing deadline if there are extenuating circumstances that prevented the claim from being submitted on time. However, this is only sometimes possible and should not be relied upon as a regular practice.
 
Incorrect patient information is a common reason for denied claims in medical billing. It can occur if the patient information provided does not match the information on file with the insurance plan. It can be due to errors in the patient's name, date of birth, or insurance coverage status.
 
To prevent this type of denial, it is important to verify all patient information before submitting a claim. It can be achieved through effective patient registration processes and regular updates to patient information in the practice's records.
 
It is also crucial for providers to stay updated on changes in a patient's insurance coverage status. This can be done through regular communication with patients, as well as through electronic insurance verification systems. By staying informed about a patient's insurance coverage, providers can help to ensure that their claims are submitted to the correct insurance plan and are more likely to be approved.
 
In conclusion, denials in medical billing can be a significant source of frustration and financial strain for healthcare providers and patients. Understanding the most common reasons for denials and taking steps to prevent them is essential for maintaining the financial health of a medical practice.
 
By following these steps, healthcare providers can help ensure that their claims are processed smoothly and that they get paid for their care. In addition, implementing a robust medical billing process and staying up to date on insurance plan requirements can help providers to avoid common pitfalls and reduce the number of denied claims. Ultimately, preventing denials in medical billing is crucial for maintaining the financial stability of a medical practice and ensuring that patients receive the care they need.

I am also interested in animating movement of elements on scroll. Let's say I have 3 card and as I scroll the care apea one by one when I scroll from a position of X= -100 to X= 0 while the hole scrolled is sopped. In other wards when the uses get to a point the normal scroll stops and as they scroll the card move from right to left raveling themself and moving into their position and ten the normal scrolling behavior start again. An example would be .
 
I don't think there is an absolute one-way-fits-all solution, so things will probably depend a lot on how exactly you imagine things to be working and how advanced your understanding of ScrollTrigger, JS and video-processing is, in general.
 
While we don't offer tutorials for effects you might have seen on other websites in this forum, searching the forums (and codepen.io, too) is always a great start for finding examples for different effects.
 
If you're having trouble with getting things properly setup for your videos being scrubbed through smoothly, you might want to consider going down a different route, scrubbing through sprites / image sequences instead...
 
As mentioned, things will heavily depend on how advanced your understanding of ScrollTrigger is. If you understand how the basic principles work and have a decent understanding of how to create the proper setup & logic for your needs around ScrollTrigger, i.e. your HTML/CSS/JS and asset preparation, almost anything is possible - if it is not logically impossible.
 
For getting a good grasp of ScrollTrigger's core principles, I'd suggest @Carl's ScrollTrigger Express course - and since ScrollTrigger is tied to GSAP, signing up for his Creative Coding Club will benefit you in general, as he also offers great courses for GSAP in general, and understanding GSAP's basics is sort of a pre-requisite for understanding ScrollTrigger.
 
So if for that question you could maybe try and re-formulate what exactly you are having problems with, alongside a minimal demo of what you have tried so far, maybe somebody will be able to help. Best would be, to also create a new thread for that question, as this does not have much to do with the title of this one, and it might be more helpful for others in future too, if that question would be topic of a different thread.
 
But as I already mentioned above - be aware that this forum is not intended for providing 'how do I do this special effect I saw somewhere else' custom-code solutions and tutorials, as the forum guidelines state.
 
It's not just in Google Chrome; Firefox [Win 11] has the same choppy result for me.

Honestly, I couldn't tell for sure, but my best guess is, that this is related to the encoding of your video;
which is super important for this and also mentioned earlier here...

 

Just from a quick glimpse at the specs of both videos, I can see huge differences between them;
for instance, you use a much higher resolution (1920x1080 vs 960x540 in the original pen) and a much higher framerate (60 fps vs 30 fps in the original codepen) - so naturally the browser would already have to do a whole lot more work with your video compared to the one in the original pen even if you followed the advice on the encoding of the video apart from the points mentioned.

Besides pointing you towards down-sizing the quality of your video and re-iterating the part about the proper encoding of your video, there isn't much I can give you advice on; as that is most likely more related to how your video is encoded / set up in general.

 
Yep, I bet @akapowl is correct - smoothly scrubbing video is **highly** dependent on how you encode your video (frame rate, codec, fps, and...most importantly...keyframe placement/frequency). It's totally unrelated to GSAP/ScrollTrigger.
 
So this worked great for the most part. Unfortunately, iOS does not play nicely with .webm files. Doesn't work at all on iOS. I ended up following along with this tutorial from CSS tricks that seemed to address the issue of transparent video not playing on iOS:
