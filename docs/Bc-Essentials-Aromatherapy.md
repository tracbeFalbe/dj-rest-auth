I discovered Madison + Green in a cute boutique in NYC and used my Rise + Refresh everyday - morning and in between meetings to help with staying sharp/awake during long days and calm to help with anxiety. There is nothing out there like these amazing scents!!!

We have been in this business for over 20 years and are passionate about all things as natural as possible. We were introduced to aromatherapy by our daughter Nikki (who now resides in Canada) many, many years ago. During our overseas experience, we had stayed with her and helped with looking after her first born whilst Nikki worked with her business.
 
What better way to relax after a long day at work, than to indulge in a hot bath. Premix 20mls of sweet almond oil with 10 drops of your choice of essential oils & pour half of the amount into the bathtub (the balance can be used to moisturise skin after towelling dry). Let the benefits of the essential oils absorb into your skin while the fragrance works to uplift your spirit.
 
Oil diffusers (burners) are an easy & effective way to disperse essential oils. From the humble tea light oil burner to the electric oil diffuser. Add 10 drops of your choice of essential oil to water & let the aroma diffuse into the room & cleanse the air.
 
This is a great way to relieve a blocked nose. Add 5-10 drops (lessor amount for children) of Eucalyptus or BREATHEZI essential oil to a bowl of very hot water. Inhale the vapour for 5-10 minutes preferably with a towel covering your head, breathe deeply.
 
Put 2-3 drops of essential oil on tissue & inhale as needed, The use of any of the remedial or lifestyle blends or single essential oils can be used in this way and may help with blocked nose, sleeplessness, etc.
 
Add 10 drops of essential oil to 50ml of water or optionally mix 10 drops of oil with 30-40 drops of SOLUBILISER/product which assists oil & water to mix, then add to water. Always shake well before spritzing!
 
An essential oil is the oil extracted from its originating plant, typically by distillation (using steam) or expression (as how citrus skins express oils when broken). The extraction process yields a highly concentrated oil that should be used with care, since its intensity can cause both external (skin) and internal irritation.
 
Essential oils have been used for millennia in cosmetic, medicinal, and aromatic applications. Evidence points to earliest use of essential oils in ancient Egypt (2000 BC), and perhaps even earlier in China and India. The Greek physician Dioscorides described use of essential oils in his medical tomes of 1st century AD, as did Avicenna, one of the forefathers of modern medicine, in the 10th century AD.
 
In the mid-20th century, Marguerite Maury, an Austrian biochemist (and finally, a woman in all this scentual history) began championing the use of essential oils mixed into a carrier oil for massage therapy. And in 1977, Robert Tisserand wrote the first English language book on the art of aromatherapy.
 
My current favorite essential oil is vetiver, extracted from the roots of a bushy grass. Vetiver smells like the spicy, fecund floor of a rainforest, and is the perfect match for a light floral, like neroli.
 
AroMed Essentials supports the health and well-being of people and the planet, by providing offerings that reduce stress and discomfort to mind and body, while helping customers achieve the highest quality of life possible.
 
Before modern medicine, people relied on the plants in their environment to heal, protect, and support their bodies. From chamomile to white willow bark, decades of trial and error led to high reliance on the natural world for a litany of ailments. While modern medicine has its advantages, these natural agents still exist, are still valuable, and are still capable of delivering those age-old benefits.
 
Could it be that the power to live a more vibrant, healthy life is locked in the best organic essential oils? Not only did our ancestors believe that to be true, but natural organic essential oils are also steadily gaining ground as viable therapeutic agents thanks to science.
 
When it comes to taking full advantage of essential oils, organic is always preferred. The purer the source used to create the oil, the better the overall effects and experience when you use the product for aromatherapy or otherwise. The best organic essential oils are free of contaminants and agents that can negate the true advantages of the oil itself.
 
At AroMed Essentials, we stand behind the true power of aromatherapy, which is only possible with high-quality ingredients. Every essential oil, oil blend, carrier oil, and CBD-infused product we offer is carefully curated from well-sourced plants and created through delicate extraction processes to retain the integrity of the ingredients. In addition, we complete third-party lab-testing to determine the purity of our products.
 
Essential oils are concentrated plant extracts that are frequently used for relaxation, stress relief and mood enhancement. Obtained through pressing or distilling a plant, each essential oil retains the natural smell by using a unique composition of chemicals, such as alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ethers, ketones, phenols and terpenes. The composition of an essential oil may vary from plant to plant, and within the same species of plants. Essential oils are used in a variety of ways, such as rubbing peppermint oil on the temples for headaches, adding tea tree oil to shampoo or inhaling through a diffuser or directly from the bottle. The oils can be used individually or combined.
 
Essential oils are not regulated in the United States. This means there is no oversight of these products to ensure quality and we do not know exactly what is in each bottle, the concentration or contaminants.
 
These highly concentrated and potent essential oils can emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The inhalation of VOCs commonly has negative effects on the respiratory system. Individuals can have different reactions to essential oils, just like they might to other medicines, products, allergens or irritant triggers.
 
Be cautious about broad health claims about essential oils. Scientific research on the efficacy and safety of essential oils for specific health conditions is limited and more evidence is needed. Some research even shows adverse health outcomes from essential oil use. For example, a 2022 study of 200 individuals demonstrated the negative association between the use of essential oils and cardiopulmonary health. Study participants who inhaled essential oils one hour or more each day had increased heart rate and blood pressure and a decreased lung function rate.
 
Aromatherapy is one of the oldest and most common uses of essential oils. Much of the research published on the benefits of aromatherapy focuses on the use of a single essential oil. However, in aromatherapy, essential oils are frequently used together. There is limited research on the combinations of essential oils, interactions between the chemicals, impacts on medications and impacts on health. It is well known that when some VOCs are combined, secondary pollutants such as formaldehyde (a known nose, throat, and lung irritant) may be produced.
 
Though some essential oils, such as tea tree oil, have antimicrobial properties, the benefits are minimal. Research suggests that the antimicrobial effect of essential oils could only be found during the first 30-60 min after the evaporation began. This was especially in the case of tea tree oil and means that continued use or dif
