Samsung is the best brand for customers who care about firmware updates. For several reasons. One is that Galaxy smartphones receive more Android OS upgrades than any other brand, including Google Pixel. The other is that Samsung is usually the first OEM to release new security patches, even ahead of Google.

Samsung also provides the ODIN tool for Android smartphone users who prefer manual updates. And as many of you who check our home page regularly know, official Samsung firmware files for ODIN are available for download on our website. We cover software update stories and discuss the latest firmware versions regularly.
 
Right now, however, we're doing something different. We're explaining what the letters and numbers associated with every firmware version mean. Once you learn this information, Samsung's firmware versions will no longer look like strings of seemingly random letters and numbers. Instead, you'll be able to read the hidden meaning behind the apparent randomness and gain all the information you need at a glance.
 
Each character or combination of characters contains specific bits of information about the firmware and the target device. The easiest way to understand Samsung's firmware number scheme is to break it down into four pieces.

**NOTE:** The 4-3-3-3 pattern works with Samsung firmware updates in most markets, except, for example, in the United States, where unlocked Galaxy devices have an additional character in their firmware numbers.
 
**NOTE:** It's important to keep in mind that the first two sections in the firmware number of your Samsung Galaxy device will never change, no matter how many updates you install. The rule is that when you install firmware updates manually, you should never try to apply updates whose first seven characters in the firmware number don't match your current version. (**Fir** **st eight characters for USA unlocked and a few other variations like FG, FN).**
 
You can find your device's Android version number, security update level, and Google Play system level in your Settings app. You'll get notifications when updates are available for you. You can also check for updates.
 
If an update starts downloading and doesn't finish, your device will automatically try again over the next few days.
When it tries again, you'll get a notification. Open the notification and tap the update action.
 
Every once in a while, your smart TV or smart monitor will receive software updates to add new features or fix bugs. No matter what model you have, keeping your software up to date is very important. You can update your TV or monitor's software over the internet or using a USB flash drive. Remember that after a software update your video and audio settings might automatically be reset to defaults.
 
If the device is connected to the internet, you can have software updates installed automatically while you're watching TV. Once the update is complete, it will be applied the next time the device is turned on. Also, when you agree to Smart Hub Terms and Conditions in the initial setup, Auto Update is set to On automatically.
 
To get the most out of your device, you should download software updates as soon as they become available. Using your TV's remote, navigate to **Menu**, then select **Settings**, and select **Support**. Select **Software Update**, and then select **Update Now**. New updates will be downloaded and installed. Updates usually take a few minutes; please do not turn off the device until the update is complete. When the update is finished, it will restart automatically. If there aren't any new updates, select **OK** to exit.

 
To download the latest software updates, visit the **Samsung Download Center**. You can either select your **Product type** and then search for your **Smart** **TV or monitor**, or select **Search your model number** to access the support page for your specific model. On the Support page, locate the firmware file for your device under Downloads. If you find multiple firmware versions, install the newest version. Select **Download** next to the firmware version to download the compressed file.

 
Copy or move all of the files that were included in the zip file to a USB flash drive, but do not place them inside any other folders. If you place the software folders inside a folder on the USB flash drive, the TV or monitor will not find them.

 
Your device will search the USB drive for update files. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the updated software. Updates usually take a few minutes; please do not turn off the TV until the update is complete. When the update is finished, it will restart automatically.
 
Sometimes, even if something is not working quite right, there won't be an update available right away. If you notice that an **app is not working**, let us help you troubleshoot it. This might be all you need to fix your problem. Some apps will be fixed by a downloadable software update, but other app updates or Smart Hub updates will download and install automatically.
 
Hi Guys, I just purchased the HW-Q800C Soundbar and noticed its at Firmware V1002 . So I wanted to upgrade it to the latest V1004 but I'm having some issues. The USB is formated to FAT32 and I have extracted the two files as the user guide says - so I have just 2 files in the root of the USB. Plugged the USB into the service port and turned on the soundbar.
 
Hi there, replying to my own post as I think its done it! Not sure what got it to go, but I formated the USB fully (not just a 'Quick Format'). Then i unplugged the soundbar from the power for 30 seconds - insert the USB and plugged power back in. After about 20 seconds it displayed UPDATE - UPS. It did this for about 1 minute the 'D.IN' and then 'WiFi' then 'LATEST VERSION'? Nothing like what the upgrade notes said would be displayed?
 
I downloaded the latest software for the Q800c on to a usb stick 1004.0 and installed it and according to SmartThings my sound bar is showing 1004.0 which is correct. And when I did a check on SmartThings to check the software version again originally it said latest update. But I had to reset the bar and now when I check the software version on SmartThings it now shows on the bar as no data
 
I just did the update, checked smart things to confirm it was at v1004 and that was it left it alone. 
A reset normally takes it back to factory settings and not sure if that includes a factory firmware level?
 
Just did a reset on the bar because I was having a few Dolby atmos issues with my Blu-ray player and since resetting it the display now says no data when checking the software version via SmartThings
 
Having a Issue in smart things my q990c only stays for a few days then drops to offline then I have to uninstall and reinstall. I'm on firmware 1002 web sight says 1004 smart things keeps telling me no update, was hoping this update would fix my issue. I download the usb files but there are two folders SAT-MT8532D23WWC and SAT-iMX8M23WWC both have a upgrade.msd file which do i use or due you do one @ a time as you can put both files in the root.
 
I just got my Q990C/ZA Soundbar(the ZA is not important, its the same device, just the full name for it in my territory/region) delivered last week, got it setup, and performed a firmware update via SmartThings app, however, it only updated firmware to version 1002, and stated that there were no new/further updates in the SmartThings app. After finding out there was in fact newer firmware, two or three versions newer(1004), I did some digging online, and decided to upgrade firmware manually to 1004 via USB. If you download the Q990C's Full Product Manual and/or Firmware Upgrade Manual from Samsung's US Customer Support- Product- Manuals and Software Site: =US&CttFileID=9037618&CD... ....you will see that the instructions are not much better on how to update via USB, but ARE a bit more clear on exactly how the Firmware folders you extract should be copied onto the USB drive, in order to successfully update the soundbar firmware.
 
I actually updated to 1004 via USB last night, using the instructions in the official Firmware Upgrade manual I downloaded online(if the link above does not work, just go to samsung.com, click the three line menu in upper right corner, and select Support--->Product Support------>Manuals & Software..... but you[OP] seem to have the Firmware files already downloaded, and in hand, so this might not even be relevant to you specifically...but for others.....)
 
I didnt even have to worry about formatting my USB thumb drive first(your situation might be different)...in fact, the USB thumb drive I used for the update, was actually formatted for Android/Google TV OS, as expandable storage for my Chromecast with Google TV, and still allowed me to perform the update without reformatting the drive first(okay, from here on out, I'm just gonna refer to it as a USB drive). I did however, delete all the files on the USB drive first though, so that there was nothing but the Firmware upgrade folders present on the drive; I just didnt bother formatting the drive before copying the firmware.
 
The instructions for updating firmware in the Q990C official product manual also state that when you attempt to update the firmware via the SmartThings app, you'll first need to unplug the bar, sub, and both rears for a full 30 seconds, and then plug them back in, and turn the bar back on, wait for all speakers to connect....then try using the update firmware button in SmartThings app to see if any new updates show up. Well, even though I was updating firmware via USB, I still followed the unplug/power cycle procedure at the start of the USB Firmware update process, as I figured it couldn't hurt anything(See below).
