FileZilla Server is an application that acts as an FTP server. Users can use a FTP client to connect to a FileZilla Server and download or upload files. Users cannot use the FileZilla Server to connect to other servers - it only allows connections in.
 
FileZilla Client is an application that allows a user to connect to an FTP server. Users can use the client to connect to any number of FTP server. The clients allow users to upload or download files etc.

filezilla server is not a web server it is an ftp server. thus if there a main computer in a LAN which can be used for supplying and receiving files. we can install filezilla in it and use it as a fileserver(FTP(file transfer protocol))
 
Right ....but just to add to that answer, the filezilla client enables the enduser to connect to the filezilla server and gives him a convenient interfaceto transfer files to and from from the filezilla server.However for the filezilla client to connect to the filezilla server the client needs to know the FZ servers ip address and port on which it is running.
 
So a simple form of usage would be to map a directory on your local system to the user account on the filezilla server and connect via fileclientto see the contents of that folder and then access it to download or uploadfiles across the network.In case of any doubts please get back.
 
If I use Plain FTP, it connects without a problem. Works fine. But when I try to use SFTP, I cannot get it to work. This has lead to a problem as our partner is convinced their end is fine, and its our side that is the issue. I am not convinced as I have tried on several devices, several networks (including one without a firewall) with the same results. I am hoping someone can help pinpoint where our problem lies or at least conclusively prove its not on our side.
 
Firewall ports were the first thing I was asked to check. I am reluctant to start messing around with our firewall ports until I am sure the changes are necessary and correct so have mainly been testing this away from the corporate network. At home, I disabled my firewall. Opened various ports that were suggested (22, 990 and also 40000 to 40100). No joy.
 
I ran into this issue awhile back. Our remote connection had an SFTP connection. Figured out FileZilla did not support SFTP at that time. Switched to WinSCP,interface was easy for user and seamlessly supported SFTP connection.
No explicit endorsement for WinSCP, but it does work nicely.
 
WinSCP is a popular free SFTP and FTP client for Windows, a powerful file manager that will improve your productivity. It supports also local-local mode and FTPS, S3, SCP and WebDAV protocols. Power users can automate WinSCP using .NET assembly.
 
Thanks to all those that chipped in. The problem was at the server side of things, mainly someone in the same position as me, not knowing enough about FTPS and SFTP. With the responses I got here, I was confident enough to be able to push it back and ask the right questions which then prompted their guy to go away and ask for a fresh eyes.
 
Ti đ c thể kết nối giữa 2 my tnh thng qua phần mềm Filezilla Client v Server. Hiện tại mnh muốn chương trnh LV nằm trn my Server c thể lấy được file từ my tnh Cilent, mnh đ sử dụng chức năng FTP Put File VI nhưng n bo lỗi (ảnh & file đnh km). Ai đ gặp trường hợp ny c thể cho ti một lời khuyn.   
Cảm ơn.

The remote path is not the path as the server is using internally. Instead you start most likely with the root, which is simply an empty path. The local path on the server is not part of what you need to enter in the FTP request.
 
I would guess, since you use the FTP Store Multiple.vi it tries to enumerate the files in the directory passed in as location to upload to the server. Only that path is obviously not a directory but a file, so the directory enumeration must fail on that.
 
Also to fully mimic the way you did with your command Filezilla test, you should use "/" as remote path. This is the root of the FTP server. But you really should be able to single step into the relevant VIs and find for yourself where things go wrong. It's not that hard.
 
I found out the reason is because my vi is running on PC server, it cannot get file from cilent PC, I switch my device running on cilent PC then it works (send and receive). But it is not as my wish, I am looking for another way to do my problem without having to run VI on cilent PC.
 
FTP obviously only can provide you with files on the computer your FTP server is running and the FTP client only can access files on the computer it is running on. That's what FTP was designed for. It would seem that what you want to do is rather a file sharing problem, in that you need to make the directory on your computer available to the server. So you need to look into creating a share. Windows networking allows that, but you should probably consult with your network administrator if you are allowed to do that.
 
After spending long painful hours circumventing group security AND windows 2008 server Firewall, and setting up FIlezilla Server on an amazon EC2 instance with the correct settings (feeew !), I was finally able to connect to my FTP Server remotely. However, Filezilla kept taunting me by spitting a "**Failed to retrieve directory listing**" error.

 After a couple of hours twisting each and every possible parameter on both server and client sides ( I tried every possible Active/Passive combination) I finally threw the towel and decided to put my last hopes on some alternative FTP client and pray. I Downloaded WinSPC and... Voil !

I am finally a happy man after a spoiled sleepless night, but I am still frustrated because I still have no Idea of what got wrong.
 
You cannot get passive mode working because the FTP server is giving the client its internal IP address (EC2 instances are behind a NAT). Hence the client timeout while trying to connect to the (unroutable...) private address.
 
Using passive mode can be useful if the client is behind a NAT router not smart enough to understand that an FTP session is starting and an incoming connection to a negotiated PORT has to be accepted.
 
We have confirmed that the filezilla 3.x (32 and 64 bit) Silent Uninstall Command line fails to cleanly remove the application. BUT, it cleanly removes itself if run manually and users attend to the prompts.

 
Also, one of my clients had a previous 64bit version installed but then needed the 32 bit instead. It would appear that the 32 installer is installing as 64 bit - this DOES NOT occur if x64 was NOT previous installed on a system.

 
The installation behavior is intentional, regardless which version you are installing, it installs over an existing installation by default to prevent multiple installations in different directories, the latter which would just lead to big confusion.

 
Issue 2 response : i didn't quite understand the business case for it either but this shouldn't matter, since our mandate is to remove the pre-existing product before installing the new version of the product. I only brought it up in case it was significant to the failing silent uninstall behavior.

 
Whilst monitoring the uninstaller I see that it hangs on the resources\default directory (there is always one randomly selected directory in here which can't be deleted, I've seen 16x16 and 480x480 stuck so far). When I try and access the folder whilst the uninstaller is running I see 'access denied or the folder does not exist'. When cancelling the uninstaller the directory which I just tried accessing disappears.

 
If I run the same uninstall command in cmd or powershell as admin then it works fine. I also noticed that if I run the uninstall command as SYSTEM from either a .bat or .ps1 script then it all runs just fine. 

 
Looking forward to seeing a solution\work-around this time around if at all possible ... Many thanks in advance for taking this on again CodesGUID! Out of curiosity, have you been able to successfully uninstall the media silently for both of the following scenarios using the command line (if so what command lines did you use exactly?):

 
This raises major concerns for enterprise users. How can they upgrade to the next version when the unattended uninstall command line is consistently failing on multiple machines, when trying to uninstall itself. This can be quite a timely and costly thing to address when needing to send Techs to each users machine to address them - especially when upgrading in an enterprise environment with multiple users.
